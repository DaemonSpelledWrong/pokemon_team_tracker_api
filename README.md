# Pokemon Team Tracker API

A small API that serves as the structure behind a web app I use for tracking Pokemon that I've used across all the different games. Preferrably I use Pokemon that I haven't used often or recently and this
tracker API helps me ensure that I don't. It is much better than relying
on my brain to remember!

## Upcoming Features
- Literally anything, since this app is currently barren. 
- Team building functionality
- Suggestion functionality
- Filtering functionality
- Accounts to associate teams with.
